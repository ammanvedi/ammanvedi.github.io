After three great years at Pulselive I am moving on, Im very pleased to say I will be joining the great people at Lifeworks and focusing on React development.

After my time at Pulselive I have learnt alot about core JS and i am excited to apply this to React. 

As this is not something I have a huge experience in i will be investing my time in getting up to scratch. In this vein I have created a react starter project that I can use as a starting point for my few projects going forward.

You can find the code [on Github](https://github.com/ammanvedi/react-starter-kit)

The starter project includes;

1. React
2. ES6
3. CSS Modules
4. Flow
5. Jest & Enzyme
6. Eslint

I need to get my SEO game on point for this site so hoping this can help anyone able to find it!!
